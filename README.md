This app (Hybrid app) is made using ionic framework.The news which is shown in the app is not owned by me.It is owned by **News18 Channel**.I own only the design of the app.

I Used the RSS feed of the news18. The RSS feed is in the form of xml. I used xml2js plugin to convert xml to javascript objects.The app consist of 17 different types of news.

```
## To run the code in your browser
Make sure you have ionic cli on your system.Once you have it, you can enter the below command
